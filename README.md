## Prettier Config

This is my personal prettier configuration that I use most of the time, feel free to use it or create your own based on it.

To use it:

1. Install the package `npm install @zaher/prettier-cofig --save-dev`
2. Update your `package.json` file, and add the following to it:

```json
{
    // ...
    "prettier": "@zaher/prettier-config"
}
```
